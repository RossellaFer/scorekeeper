# Score Keeper

Mini project made after watching the Score Keeper tutorial on "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. Very simple app to keep track of some daily tasks. When you click on the different li elements, the "complete" style is applied and the scoreDisplay span is updated. 

Technologies used:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox

Future improvements:
- Making the page responsive
- Reward image/badge when completing all tasks
- Possibility to add new tasks
